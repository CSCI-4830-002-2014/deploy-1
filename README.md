## When working with "Big Data" on your own laptop, what memory barriers might you run into?  Explain your answer. [5 pts]

[Provide Explanation]


## What limitations may you run into doing data collection via arduino? (5 pts)

[Provide Explanation]

--------------------

For the next part of the assignment, you will look at your sample data.

## State the research question of your mini-project. (1 point)
[Statement here]

## What would you define as your 'signal' you are looking for in your data?  That is, what might constitute as finding something of interest to your question? (5 pts)

[Response]

## Insert a small sample of your data where you notice something that might be a signal and explain why you think so. (5 pts)

[Insert Data snippet]
[Explanation]

## Provide a data snippet of some noise you've encountered in your data collection, then try to explain it. (5 pts)  

[Data snippet]
[Explanation]

## How might you go about getting rid of the noise? (Don't worry, we'll learn more about this, but try to think of a first method) (5 pt)

[Explan your method]

## For your research question, do you think your biggest challenge is in the sampling (i.e., getting valid data) or the analysis (i.e., cleaning noise out of your data)?  Explain (4 pts)

[Explanation]

## In thinking ahead about the big project, what additional Arduino tools may be helpful for getting higher fidelity data?  Do a bit of your own research here.

[Explain at least one tool]
