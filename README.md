## What maximum bit size does an Arduino Uno use and what's the largest number it can represent? (3 pts)

[16]
[1024]

## What amount of RAM is embedded on the arduino board? (2 pts)

[2 KB]

## What is the maximum bit representation you can get from data using analogRead()?   (2 pts)

[phone]
[int (0 to 1023)]

## What is the maximum sampling rate of an analogRead() in arduino? (3 pts)

[maximum reading rate is about 10,000 times a second.]

## When working with "Big Data" on your own laptop, what memory barriers might you run into?  Explain your answer. [5 pts]

[If the data sampling is big enough than it will not be able to analized appropriately on a laptop]


## What limitations may you run into doing data collection via arduino? (5 pts)

[collecting too much data and not being able to interpret it]

--------------------

For the next part of the assignment, you will look at your sample data.

## State the research question of your mini-project. (1 point)
[Worst times to study at my house]

## What would you define as your 'signal' you are looking for in your data?  That is, what might constitute as finding something of interest to your question? (5 pts)

[examing the loudest/busiest times at my house, find a time my house becomes loud and or quite when I would not assume such  would be an interesting discovery]

## Insert a small sample of your data where you notice something that might be a signal and explain why you think so. (5 pts)

[here we see a large amount of data seems to have been captured smoothly]

## Provide a data snippet of some noise you've encountered in your data collection, then try to explain it. (5 pts)  

[http://i.imgur.com/jBuWo8W.png]
[not sure what happened here to the data]

## How might you go about getting rid of the noise? (Don't worry, we'll learn more about this, but try to think of a first method) (5 pt)

[make sure the board is in a safe place?]

## For your research question, do you think your biggest challenge is in the sampling (i.e., getting valid data) or the analysis (i.e., cleaning noise out of your data)?  Explain (4 pts)

[i think that getting valid data and being able to accurately decipher it will be the biggest challenge]

## In thinking ahead about the big project, what additional Arduino tools may be helpful for getting higher fidelity data?  Do a bit of your own research here.

[this tool has the possibility to use LED lights which supposedly are capible of comunnicating with other IR shields, this could be helpfull because this communication could bring about more accurate and comprehensible data. potentially matching the data sets to see if one is different from the other would help ensure data is accurate]
